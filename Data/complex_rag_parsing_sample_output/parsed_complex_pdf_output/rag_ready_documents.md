Complex RAG Parsing Sample - synthetic document
Page 1
Complex Document for RAG Parsing Tests
Synthetic 15-page PDF with paragraphs, simple and complex tables, diagrams, scanned-form style image, metadata
examples, and production RAG edge cases.
Story Line
Three client teams - Arka Finance, BlueLeaf Retail, and CityRide Mobility - are migrating contracts, policies, support records,
and operational reports into a single RAG platform. Each team has different document types, access rules, and parsing
challenges. The RAG system must answer questions with citations while ensuring that one client never sees another clients
data.
This PDF is intentionally designed to test document loaders, PDF parsers, OCR workflows, table extraction, chunking
strategies, metadata preservation, and source citation quality.
Key statement: RAG does not train the model. RAG gives the model the right context before answering.

1. Business Scenario
The platform team is building a document intelligence layer for contract operations. Legal users need answers such as: Which
contracts renew automatically? Which agreements have a 60-day termination notice? Which documents mention data
residency in India? These questions require retrieval across multiple document types and sometimes across multiple related
documents of a single client.
Support teams also want answers from SOPs, markdown runbooks, HTML exports, chat transcripts, and CSV logs. A single
parser is not enough because the corpus contains born-digital PDFs, scanned forms, HTML, markdown, and spreadsheet-like
tables.

3. Contract Excerpt: Dense Legal Text
Clause 7.2 - Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information using at least the same
degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential materials, but in no event less than reasonable care. Confidential
Information includes technical documents, pricing schedules, user lists, API keys, operational procedures, security reports,
incident response notes, product roadmaps, and any derived analysis prepared by the Receiving Party.
Clause 7.3 - Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly available without breach,
independently developed without reference to the Disclosing Party material, received lawfully from a third party, or approved
for release in writing. The burden of proving an exclusion remains with the Receiving Party.
Clause 9.1 - Data Residency. If the Statement of Work identifies a specific processing region, the service provider shall
process production records only within that region unless the client approves a transfer in writing. Disaster recovery replicas
may be stored in a secondary region if encryption at rest and access logging are enabled.
Clause 11.4 - Termination Assistance. Upon termination, the provider shall make client data available for export for a period
of thirty days. After the export period, the provider may delete production data according to the deletion schedule unless a
legal hold applies.

column detection, short text values, and numeric values.

Refunds
Refund requests must be raised within 7 days of
purchase.
Customer Support
Quarterly
Data Export
Client admins can request export in CSV or JSON
format.
Platform Ops
Monthly
Access Review
Privileged access must be reviewed every 30 days.
Security
Monthly
Incident Response
Critical incidents require acknowledgement within 30
minutes.
SRE
After each incident
Vendor Review
High-risk vendors require annual risk assessment.
Procurement
Annual
Narrative Around the Table
This table appears between paragraphs, which is common in enterprise documents. A good parser should preserve the
paragraph before the table, the table content, and the paragraph after the table in the correct reading order.
For RAG systems, simple tables are often converted into row-wise text chunks such as: Policy Area: Refunds; Rule: Refund
requests must be raised within 7 days; Owner: Customer Support.

7. Markdown Runbook Excerpt
Markdown files are often easier to parse because headings and code blocks are explicit. However, when markdown is
exported to PDF, the structure may become visual rather than semantic.
# Runbook: Contract Ingestion Failure
## Symptoms
- Upload status remains `processing` for more than 30 minutes.
- Worker logs show repeated timeout errors.
- Vector count does not increase for the affected document.
## Recovery Steps
1. Confirm the object exists in document storage.
2. Re-run parser with `safe_mode=True`.
3. Rebuild chunks with the previous chunking configuration.
4. Compare chunk count with the last successful ingestion.
5. Trigger re-embedding only for changed chunks.
A good parser should preserve code block boundaries and avoid mixing numbered steps with surrounding prose. In RAG,
runbooks are useful because users often ask operational questions that require exact steps.

10. Multi-tenant Retrieval and Access Control
In a multi-tenant RAG system, each document, chunk, embedding, and retrieval request should be associated with a tenant
identifier. Client isolation should happen before the LLM receives any context.
Layer
Control
Failure mode if missing
Authentication
Identify user and organization
Unknown user may access application
Authorization
Map user to client_id and role
User may retrieve another clients documents
Vector retrieval
Filter by client_id or namespace
Retriever may return unauthorized chunks
Prompt construction
Send only allowed context
LLM may see sensitive data
Audit logging
Record query, source chunks, user_id
No traceability during incident review
Correct flow: authenticate user, get client_id from backend, retrieve only matching chunks, build prompt with authorized
context, return answer with citations.
Wrong flow: retrieve from all clients and tell the model to ignore unauthorized content. This is unsafe because the LLM should
not be used as the access-control boundary.

13. Edge Cases for Parsers
The following cases often break real document ingestion pipelines. They are included here as guidance for testing parser
quality before moving to embeddings and vector storage.
Edge case
Example
Recommended handling
Repeated headers and
footers
Page number, confidentiality banner
Remove or store separately as metadata
Hyphenated line breaks
termi- nation assistance
Normalize during cleaning
Rotated tables
Landscape appendix in PDF
Use layout-aware parser or OCR
Merged cells
Pricing table with grouped plans
Preserve hierarchy in row text
Scanned signatures
Signature block as image
OCR if text is needed; store image reference
Boilerplate navigation
Website header and footer
Use boilerplate removal
Duplicate chunks
Same policy in FAQ and PDF
Deduplicate using source and hash
Bad parsing creates bad chunks. Bad chunks create bad retrieval. Bad retrieval creates bad answers.

15. Final Ingestion Checklist
Use this checklist before sending parsed content into chunking and embeddings. It helps identify whether the data is ready for
production RAG.
Checklist item
Status to verify
Why it matters
Text extraction
Paragraphs are readable and ordered
Prevents noisy chunks
Table extraction
Rows, columns, headers, and footnotes
preserved
Protects factual answers
Image handling
Captions indexed and OCR done if required
Avoids missing visual information
Metadata
source, page, client_id, document_id
captured
Enables citations and access control
Chunking
Chunks preserve meaning and section
boundaries
Improves retrieval relevance
Access control
Retrieval filters use authenticated client_id
Prevents data leakage
Evaluation
Golden questions tested with citations
Measures real answer quality
Summary: RAG is about knowledge access. Fine-tuning is about behavior adaptation. For document intelligence, parsing
quality is the foundation. If extraction is weak, no embedding model or LLM can fully fix the missing context.
